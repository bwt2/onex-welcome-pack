# oNex Welcome Pack
## Frontend
Run the frontend from `/apps/frontend` by

```bash
npm i # only for initial setup
npm run dev
```
## Backend
Run the backend server from the root of the project with

```bash
npm i # only for initial setup
node --env-file=.env apps/backend/index.ts 
```

## Notes
### General
- Vanilla react vs react router v7 (rr7) / remix $\to$ vanilla react to focus experimenting more on backend stuff rather than messing around with frontend, if I have time will migrate the rr7 for csr/ssr/ssg capabilities
